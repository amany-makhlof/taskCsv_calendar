Test 1 â€“ Script which generates CSV output
A HR coordinator would like to organise social events for the business over the next 12 months.
The following events occur every month:
- First Monday of the month - Brunch & catchup.
- Thirsty Thursday - Every 3rd Thursday of the month.
- Friday Fry-up - Last Friday of the month.
You should produce a CSV file in the following format:
Month Brunch & Catchup Thirsty Thursday Friday Fry-up
m/Y d/m/Y d/m/Y d/m/Y
m/Y d/m/Y d/m/Y d/m/Y
Your CSV should contain 13 rows, one for the headers and the next 12 rows to output the next 12 months of
social events with the relevant dates populated.
We would like to see a script which shows your skills in the following areas:
- OOP design skills.
- Class /method documentation and design decisions.
- Considerations for maintenance & expansion of logic.
- Script should be executable from CLI.
